## Data Ingestion Artifacts

This folder stores raw exports and processed knowledge files generated by the
ingestion scripts. Keeping these artifacts versioned (or archived externally)
lets you audit what the chatbot learned during each refresh.

- `shopify/`
  - `shopify_products_raw.json`: direct dump from `https://bmcuruguay.com.uy/products.json`.
    Generated by `python python-scripts/fetch_shopify_products.py`.
- `mercadolibre/`
  - `mercadolibre_questions_raw.json`: raw questions pulled via the Mercado Libre
    API or converted from a CSV export (`--csv-export data/mercadolibre/export.csv`).

Processed knowledge files land at the repository root:

- `conocimiento_shopify.json`: normalized product catalog ready for consolidation.
- `conocimiento_mercadolibre.json`: normalized Mercado Libre interactions ready for consolidation.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHOPIFY_PAGE_SIZE` | Page size for public Shopify API pagination | `250` |
| `MELI_ACCESS_TOKEN` | OAuth token for Mercado Libre API | *(required for API sync)* |
| `MELI_SELLER_ID` | Seller ID used in `/questions/search` | *(required for API sync)* |
| `RUN_SHOPIFY_SYNC` | Set to `false` to skip Shopify ingestion during `refresh_knowledge.sh` | `true` |
| `RUN_MELI_SYNC` | Set to `false` to skip Mercado Libre ingestion during `refresh_knowledge.sh` | `true` |

When Mercado Libre credentials are not available, leave the env vars unset;
the ingestion step will be skipped automatically. You can still drop a CSV
export into `data/mercadolibre/` and convert it manually later.
