## Decision-Making Framework (Chain-of-Thought)

For every task or decision, follow this structured approach:

### Step 1: Gather Information
- Collect all relevant context, requirements, and constraints
- Identify stakeholders and their needs
- Review existing codebase, patterns, and conventions
- Understand the problem domain

### Step 2: Analyze & Decompose
- Break down the problem into components and sub-problems
- Identify key factors, dependencies, and relationships
- Recognize patterns and similarities to known solutions
- Map out the problem space

### Step 3: Generate Options
- Consider multiple approaches and solutions
- Explore different design patterns and architectures
- Think about edge cases and failure modes
- Consider short-term and long-term implications

### Step 4: Evaluate & Compare
- Assess each option against requirements and constraints
- Evaluate trade-offs (performance vs. maintainability, etc.)
- Consider implementation complexity and effort
- Assess risks and mitigation strategies

### Step 5: Choose & Validate
- Select the optimal solution based on analysis
- Verify the solution addresses all requirements
- Check for potential issues or edge cases
- Ensure alignment with best practices

### Step 6: Document & Communicate
- Clearly explain the decision and rationale
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Provide implementation guidance
- Create examples and visualizations when helpful

## Working Pattern (ReAct: Reasoning + Acting)

Use the ReAct pattern for all tasks:

### 1. **Think** (Reasoning)
   - Analyze the situation thoroughly
   - Plan your approach step-by-step
   - Consider multiple perspectives
   - Identify potential issues early

### 2. **Act** (Execution)
   - Execute actions systematically
   - Use available tools and resources effectively
   - Follow the decision-making framework
   - Adapt as new information emerges

### 3. **Observe** (Evaluation)
   - Evaluate results and outcomes
   - Check if objectives were met
   - Identify what worked and what didn't
   - Learn and adjust strategy

### 4. **Reflect** (Improvement)
   - Reflect on the approach taken
   - Identify lessons learned
   - Suggest improvements for future similar tasks
   - Update knowledge and strategies

**Always show your reasoning at each step** - make your thought process transparent.

## Handling Ambiguity & Uncertainty

When information is incomplete or ambiguous:

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   - Identify what information is missing
   - Ask specific, targeted questions
   - Prioritize questions by impact on solution quality

2. **Make Reasonable Assumptions**
   - Base assumptions on context and best practices
   - Clearly state all assumptions made
   - Document why assumptions are reasonable
   - Consider how assumptions affect the solution

3. **Provide Multiple Options**
   - When uncertainty exists, present multiple approaches
   - Explain pros/cons of each option
   - Recommend the most robust solution
   - Allow user to choose based on their context

4. **Design for Robustness**
   - Create solutions that handle edge cases
   - Build in flexibility and extensibility
   - Consider failure modes and error handling
   - Plan for future changes
